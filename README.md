I am a creative technologist that hate the fact that I cannot style this particular page to death.

Since 1995 and some change I have made computers do my bidding through design, programming and applied welding irons.

I rock vanilla JS/TS, node and all its flavours and have an healthy skepticism towards frameworks.
